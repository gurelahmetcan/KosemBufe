> **Role:** Professional Game Developer (Unity/C# or Godot/GDScript)
> **Task:** Create a simplified "Hold-to-Slice" mechanic for the **Sucuk Dilimleme**  station.
> **Scene Setup:**
> 1. **Knife Object:** A 3D model that starts at a "High" position.
> 2. **Sucuk Object:** A 3D model representing the meat.
> 2. **Cutting Board:** A static surface where the slicing happens.
> **Core Logic:**
> 1. **Input:** When the player **holds down** the **Left Mouse Button (LMB)**:
>     - Move the Knife from its "High" position toward the "Board" position at a constant `sliceSpeed`.
> 2. **The Slice Trigger:** Once the Knife reaches the "Board" position:
>     - **Spawn Slice:** Instantiate a small "Slice" object at the knife's current position.
>     - **Advance Meat:** Move the main "Sucuk" object forward by a fixed `sliceWidth`.
>     - **Auto-Reset:** Immediately move the Knife back to the "High" position to allow continuous slicing while LMB is held.
> 3. **Visual Feedback:**Implement a subtle screen shake (0.1 magnitude) each time the Knife hits the board to maintain **Tactile Gameplay**.
>     - No sound effects are required for this version.
> 
> **Variables to Expose:**
> 
> - `sliceSpeed`: Speed of the downward movement.
> - `sliceWidth`: Thickness of each generated slice.
> - `resetSpeed`: Speed of the knife returning to the start position.
> 
> **Please provide the code and instructions for setup.**
